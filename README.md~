a phenppacket is:  
A hieriartical record consisting of an identified container 
with one or or more sections deawn from these catagories:
  
    "title"
    "entities"
    "variants"
    "persons"
    "organisms"
    "phenotype_profile"
    "diagnosis_profile"
    "environment_profile"

( 
 Does order matter? 
 Should catagories be lexicaly ordered? 
 Can there be repeats? 
 What about empty sections?
 Can there be repetes? 
 Is it a set?
)
